        <h1>Scrambled Eggs</h1>
        <p>Eggs are one of my favorite foods. Here is a recipe for deliciously rich scrambled eggs.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>2 tbsp cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a frying pan over a medium heat.</li>
            <li>Gently mix the eggs and cream in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Once butter has melted add cream and eggs.</li>
            <li>Using a spatula find the eggs from the edge of the pan to the center every 20 seconds (as if you are making an omlette).</li>
            <li>When the eggs are still moist remove from the heat (it will continue to cook on the plate until served).</li>
        </ol>
