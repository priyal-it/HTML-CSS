        <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <cite>Nature</cite>, <cite>New Scientist</cite>, and all other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On the Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favourite book since collegem and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.<br/>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do.</q> Although many considered her pioneering work, unravelling the secrets of the llama <abbr title="deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.</p>
