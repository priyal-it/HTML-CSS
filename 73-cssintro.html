        <p>A <i>potager</i> is a French term for an ornamental vegetable or kitchen garden. Often flowers (edible and non-edible) and herbs are planted with the vegetables to enhance the garden's beauty The goal is to make the function of providing food aesthetically pleasing.</p>
        <h2 class="headings">What to Plant</h2>
        <p>Plants are chosen as much for their functionality as for their color and form. Many are trained to grow upward. A well-designed potger can provide food, cut flowers and herbs for the home with very little maintenance. Potagers can disguise their function of providing for a home in a wide array of forms - from the carefree style of the cottage garden to the formality of a knot garden.</p>
